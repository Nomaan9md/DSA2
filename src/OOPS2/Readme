---------------------------------------------------------------------------
An instance variable is a variable that is associated with an instance of a class. Unlike static variables,
instance variables are defined in a class but outside any method and are specific to each object of that class.
This means that each object has its own copy of an instance variable, so changes to the variable in one
object do not affect other objects. Instance variables are commonly used to store the state of an object.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inheritance
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and methods of another class.

👉 The class that is inherited from = Parent/Super Class
👉 The class that inherits = Child/Sub Class

This helps in:

Code reusability

Reducing duplication

Building real- world relationships (Car → SportsCar)

Types of Inheritance in Java

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java supports:

Single inheritance

Multilevel inheritance

Hierarchical inheritance

(Java does NOT support multiple inheritance using classes.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is super keyword?

super is used to refer to immediate parent class.

You use super for:

Calling parent class constructor

Accessing parent class variables

Calling parent class methods

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How super is used here?
Usage	                     Example	                Meaning
Call parent constructor	     super(brand, speed)	    Initializes parent fields
Access parent method	     super.display()	        Runs Car's display()
Access parent variables	     super.brand (if needed)	Gets parent’s value

Programming to an Interface rather than a Concrete Implementation” — one of the most important OOP principles.

instead of AdvancedCar ad = new AdvancedCar(3, "Automatic", 4,4) we did this

👉 car advanceCar = new AdvancedCar(3, "Automatic", 4,4);

| Access Modifier           | Accessible Within Same Class | Same Package | Subclass (Different Package) | Other Packages | Keyword Used |

| **public**                | ✔ Yes                        | ✔ Yes        | ✔ Yes                        | ✔ Yes          | `public`     |
| **protected**             | ✔ Yes                        | ✔ Yes        | ✔ Yes                        | ❌ No          | `protected`  |
| **default** (no modifier) | ✔ Yes                        | ✔ Yes        | ❌ No                         | ❌ No         | *(none)*     |
| **private**               | ✔ Yes                        | ❌ No         | ❌ No                         | ❌ No        | `private`    |

Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)

Runtime polymorphism occurs when a method is called based on the object's actual type at runtime, not the reference type.

👉 Achieved using method overriding
👉 Decided by JVM during program execution (runtime)
👉 Supports flexibility and extensibility


Dynamic Method Dispatch
Dynamic Method Dispatch is the mechanism that enables runtime polymorphism.

It means: When a parent class reference points to a child class object, the overridden method of the child class is executed.

constructor overloading and methode overloading fall under compile time polymorphism


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Feature       | Compile-time Polymorphism                         | Runtime Polymorphism        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Also called   | Early binding                                     | Late binding                |
| Decision time | Compile time                                      | Runtime                     |

| Parameters    | Must be different                                 | Must be same                |
| Return type   | Can be same or different                          | Must be same (or covariant) |
| Speed         | Faster                                            | Slightly slower             |
| Flexibility   | Less flexible                                     | More flexible               |
| Example       | `add(int a, int b)` vs `add(int a, int b, int c)` | Parent ref → Child object   |
