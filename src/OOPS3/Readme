What is Abstraction?
 -> Abstraction means showing only the important information and hiding the unnecessary details.

 Why do we use Abstraction?
 ✔ Makes code simple
 ✔ Hides complexity
 ✔ Increases security (only necessary actions allowed)
 ✔ Helps in maintaining and updating code easily

Abstract Methode is a body-less which does not have its own implementation nut everyone who is extending from
abstract class had to implement this methode

example
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();  // no body -> hiding details

    void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

What is an Interface?
- An interface is like a contract in Java.
- It tells what a class must do, but not how to do it.
- It only contains method names (signatures), and the class that uses it must provide the actual implementation.

Why do we use Interfaces?
✔ To achieve 100% abstraction
✔ To follow multiple inheritance (Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance with classes, but with interfaces it does)
✔ To define rules/standards for classes

we cannot define a constructor in an interface and we cannot define instance variable in an interface


Example -:
interface Camera {
    void takePhoto();
    default void save(){
      save photos;
    }
}

interface MusicPlayer {
    void playMusic();
}

class Smartphone implements Camera, MusicPlayer {
    public void takePhoto() {
        System.out.println("Photo Clicked");
    }

    public void playMusic() {
        System.out.println("Playing Music");
    }
}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Rules of Interface

✔ Methods are public abstract by default
✔ Variables are public static final (constant)
✔ A class uses implements to use an interface
✔ A class must implement all methods in the interface
✔ One class can implement multiple interfaces

What is a Default Method in an Interface?
- A default method is a method in an interface that has a body (implementation).

we can extends interface with another interface
multiple implementation of an interface to a class is allowed.
