Binary Search

Binary Search is a fast searching algorithm used to find an element in a sorted array.

Key Idea
Instead of checking each element one by one (like Linear Search), Binary Search divides the search space into half every time.

Conditions
The array must be sorted (ascending or descending).


Time Complexity: O(log n) (very fast)
Space Complexity: O(1)

How it works (simple steps)

Start with two pointers:
 -->  low = 0
 -->  high = array.length - 1

Find the middle index:
 -->  mid = (low + high) / 2

Compare the middle element with the target:
 -->  If arr[mid] == target, element is found.
 -->  If arr[mid] < target, search in right half → low = mid + 1
 -->  If arr[mid] > target, search in left half → high = mid - 1

Repeat until low > high.
